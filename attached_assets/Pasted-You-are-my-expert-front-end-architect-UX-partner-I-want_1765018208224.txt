You are my expert front-end architect + UX partner.
I want you to build a complete personal portfolio website for me based ONLY on:

The resume file I’ve attached

The instructions in this prompt

GOAL & POSITIONING

Build a single-developer portfolio for a Senior Frontend / UI Engineer & UI/UX Developer with ~10 years of experience and 6+ years in Angular.

Position me as someone who can grow into a Front-End Architect / UI Engineering Lead role.

Tone: confident, clear, professional, no fluff, no buzzword spam.

THEME & VIBE

Visual theme: “Flow of Nature” — smooth, organic, calm, but still modern and tech-ready.

Think: flowing sections, soft curves, good whitespace, subtle gradients, smooth transitions.

Dark-on-light or soft dark theme that feels minimal and premium.

TECH & STRUCTURE

Use modern HTML + CSS + TypeScript-friendly JS structure, easily portable into Angular later.

Keep it component-minded: clear sections and reusable utility classes.

Use CSS only (no Tailwind / Bootstrap) but keep classes semantic and tidy.

Make it fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).

No build tools required – just a clean structure like:

index.html

styles.css

script.js (only if really needed, otherwise stick to CSS and simple interactions)

PAGES / SECTIONS

Build it as a single-page portfolio with smooth scrolling navigation containing these sections:

Hero / Intro

Name, title (use my real title from the resume).

Short 2–3 line summary written at an architect-level (ownership, systems thinking, UX focus).

A clean CTA row: “View Projects”, “Download Resume”, “Contact”.

Skills & Tech Stack

Use skills from my resume, grouped like:

Frontend (Angular versions, TS, JS, RxJS, HTML, CSS, SCSS)

UI/UX (Responsive UI, design systems, theming, animations, Figma-to-UI, etc.)

Architecture (component-driven design, lazy loading, state mgmt, performance, API patterns)

Tools (put whatever is in my resume)

Show skills in a visual layout: tags, grouped cards, or a simple grid.

Highlighted Projects / Case Studies

From the resume, extract my top 3–5 projects (like Arthakosh, TMS, container portals, etc.).

For each project, show:

Name

Short description < 200 characters

My role & contributions (focus on architecture, UX, performance, complex UI work)

Tech used

Write content in resume-friendly, recruiter-friendly language (short, sharp, bullet-like).

Experience Timeline

Take my work experience from the resume and build a vertical timeline.

For each role: Company, Role, Duration, Key impact bullets (2–4 per role).

Emphasize front-end ownership, design collaboration, and system-level thinking.

Approach / How I Work

A small section that explains how I think about:

UI/UX decisions

Component architecture

Performance

Collaboration with backend / design

Base this on clues from my resume plus what’s typical for a senior frontend/UI engineer.

Contact

Simple contact section with:

Email (placeholder)

LinkedIn (placeholder)

GitHub (placeholder)

Make these easy to swap out later.

DESIGN & INTERACTIONS

Use smooth scroll, gentle hover states, and subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, translateY).

Reflect the “flow of nature” in:

Section dividers (curved, wavy, or organic shapes using pure CSS and SVG if needed)

Backgrounds (soft gradients or subtle textures)

Avoid heavy parallax or over-the-top effects. Keep it fast and lightweight.

CONTENT RULES

Extract real data (experience, projects, skills) from my attached resume wherever possible.

Where details are missing, fill with sensible, realistic placeholders, but keep them minimal.

NO lorem ipsum.

DELIVERABLE

Return the complete code with:

Full index.html (semantic, accessible structure)

styles.css (organized sections, comments for each main section)

script.js (only if actually needed for interactions like smooth scroll, else skip)

Make sure the code is ready to paste into a Replit project and run immediately.

At the end, briefly explain:

How the layout is structured

Where I can change my info (name, title, resume link, project details, social links)

Which parts are best starting points if I later convert this into an Angular app.

Use clean, production-quality code and keep everything focused on my profile from the resume.
